    <h2>Coffey Communications</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.coffeycomm.com/" target="_blank">Coffey Communications</a> works with health care providers and health plan providers to communicate with their communities through printed pieces and websites. After I graduated from Bowling Green State University in 2011, I started working at Coffey Communications as a Web Designer. My responsibilities included designing and building websites for clients, designing new releases for Coffey's netReturns app, designing e-newsletters, designing support materials (printed and online) for the netReturns modules, and making updates to client websites based on client requests.</p>
    <p>Coffey does not allow for any of their designers to post or share the work that they during their employment there. So sadly, I cannot share the four redesigns that I did for Coffey clients.</p>
