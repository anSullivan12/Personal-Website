    <h2>Third Coast Music</h2>
    <p><a href="http://thirdcoastm.com/" target="_blank">Third Coast Music</a> is a company that I started working with on a freelance basis in 2016. First, I started by helping them with their logo after a name change. I took the logotype that TCM had and updated it using Adobe Illustrator and delivered multiple file formats that could be used for anything they may need in the future.</p>
    <p>Then I helped the ladies of Third Coast Music build their website using SquareSpace. I helped them choose a design that was best suited for their content and product. I guided them as they curated their content and photos, and then taught them how to upload everything to SquareSpace.</p>
    <p>After the launch of their website, Third Coast Music has needed various printed materials for self-promotion. I've designed and built these using Adobe InDesign or sometimes Photoshop.</p>
